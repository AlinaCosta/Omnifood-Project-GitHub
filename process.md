# The Process Behind Building A Website

First, define and plan the project.
Then start thinking about the layout of the page and
create some initial sketches.
And only then after these three phases,
start designing and building the website.
Then once that is done, test and optimize that page before
launch it.
And any website that is live on the web needs to be
maintained and updated.

## Define The Project

### Define Who the website is for.

Is it for yourself? For a client
of your agency or your freelancing business?

### Define WHAT the website is for.

Define business and user goals of your website project.(What is the main goal or the main purpose of the site? Is it to provide information? Or to sell some product?
Or is it simply to entertain the user?

It's about defining your business goals and user goals for this
particular project.)

---

[EXEMPLE:]

A company that produces premium dog food.

- Business goal : Selling premium dog food
- User goal : Finding high-qualily dog food for good price

---

### Define a target audience.

Be really specific if possible and if it makes sense for your
website(this can come from your client)

---

[Example:] "Women , 20 to 40 years old, living in Europe, earning
over 2000$/month, with a passion for dogs"

---

---

You want to design all your goals and target audience in mind.
The better you know who you build a website for and what you want to achieve with it, the more success your project will have in the end.

---

## Plan The Project

Plan and gather website content: copy (text), images, videos etc.

Content is usually provided by the client, but you also can help
them produse and find some content (simply finding free images is
easiest, but if they want copy, charge them extra)

For bigger sites, plan out the sitemap, what pages the site needs,
and how they are related to one another (content hierarchy)

Based on the content, plan what sections each page needs in order
to convey the content's message, and in which order

---

The content is who sould guide the project and the design of the
website in the end.

---

Now, finally, based on everything you already know about the
company and the project and all of your content,it is now time
to also define the website personality that you will want to implement in your design.

## Sketch Layout And Component Ideas

Think about what components you need, and how you can use them in layout patterns(Web Design section)

Get ideas out of your head: sketch them with pen and paper or with some design software (Figma)

This is an iterative process: experiment with different components
and layouts, until you arrive at a first good solution.

You don't need to sketch everything, and don't make it perfect.
At some point, you're ready to jump into HTML and CSS

## Design and build website

Use decisions, content and sketches to design and build the website with HTML and CSS ("designing in the browser")

Create the design based on selected website personality, the design guidelines and inspiration ( see web design section)

Use the client's branding(it if exists already) for design decisions whenever possible: colors, typography, icons, etc

## Test and optimize

Make sure website works well in all major browsers(Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, old IE)

Test the website on actual mobile devices, not just in DevTools

Optimize all images, in terms of dimensions and file size(see lecture on images): give them the right dimensions in pixels and compress
them in order to not force our users to download huge images.

Fix simple accessibility problems(color contrast issues)

Run the Lighthouse performance test in Chrome DevTools and try to fix reported issues.

Think about Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

## Launch The MASTERPIECE

Once all work is done, everything is perfect, and you got approval from your client( or yourself), it's time to share your masterpiece with the world!

Upload your website files to a hosting platform. There are countless platform, we will use one with a free plan (Netlify)

Choose and buy a great domain name, one that represents the brand well, is memorable and easy to write.

## Maintain and keep updating website

Launching is not the end...

Keep the website content updated over time. If you're working with a client, you can create a monthly maintenance contract

Install analytics software (Google Analytics or Fathom) to get statistics about website users. This may inform future changes in the site structure and content.

A blog that is updated regularly is a good way to keep users coming back, and is also good for SEO.
